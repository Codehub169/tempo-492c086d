      <p>If you see this message, the basic rendering and routing to UploadPage is working.</p>
      <p>Please check your browser's developer console (usually F12) for any errors that might have occurred before this simplified page attempted to render.</p>
      <p>
        If this simplified page shows, the issue is likely within the original, more complex UploadPage.js code (the version prior to this test) or its specific imports (like '../services/api').
      </p>
      <p>
        If this simplified page does NOT show, or you still see a blank screen, the issue is more likely in your App.js (e.g., React Router setup, App.css import) or a fundamental JavaScript error elsewhere that prevents React from rendering anything.
